      <p>I used to stare at this girl Carmen in Sunday school. The teacher would say words like sin and Jesus and grace, and I just couldn’t stop looking at Carmen, at the white tip of cleavage thrusting out of her dress. I think maybe I loved her. She didn’t love me back. I know this because in seven years of Bible classes she spoke fewer words to me than I’ve written in this sentence. I failed at love. When I saw her sometimes, from far away, I felt like there was no use in wanting anything. At these times I’d look to the clouds and ask God why, after all my prayers, why?And then, around the time I turned sixteen, I abruptly stopped failing. I remember the day it happened. The moment. Me and my friend for life Daryl were eating together at a long table in our church’s fellowship hall. It was Sunday, and the preacher had finished his sermon, and the whole congregation had packed into the hall for a potluck dinner. The room was crowded and smelled of fried chicken. Daryl held up a spoon and made airplane noises. He was, objectively, too old to play airplane with his utensils, but for as long as I’d known him he’d dreamed of one day becoming a fighter pilot, and he took the dream quite seriously. To be Daryl’s friend—his true friend, as I was—one had to make certain allowances.</p>
      <p>Daryl was making machine gun noises and strafing a pile of mashed potatoes when Carmen sat down in the chair beside me. Carmen of black hair and pale skin. Carmen of my private dreams. She asked for a book of matches. And she’d come to the right guy: I was an acolyte, meaning I lit the altar candles before Sunday services. From a young age I’d been tasked with carrying light into the sanctuary.</p>
      <p>Carmen told me to meet her outside with the matches. She used her thumb to clear a lock of hair away from her face, then stood up and left. I looked to Daryl. He lowered his spoon to the table. He looked at his plate of food thoughtfully for a moment.</p>
      <p>“You’d better do what she wants,” he said. “If you don’t, she’ll probably murder you.”</p>
      <p>“You’d better do what she wants,” he said. “If you don’t, she’ll probably murder you.”</p>
      <p>“Not for long you wouldn’t,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I mean if she just murdered me a little.”</p>
      <p>The next thing I did was snatch a book of matches from the shelf in the narthex where I stored my robe and candle lighter. Then I caught up with Carmen on the stone steps outside the church.</p>
      <p>“Thanks, dork,” she said, rolling her eyes as I sat beside her. She held a cigarette casually between two fingers. “Hand them over.”</p>
      <p>But I had something better in mind. Something cinematic. I opened the book and tore out a cardboard match. In the instant it took to scrape the match head against the striker, I prayed silently to God for it to light on my first try. The miniature torch sizzled and burned, and I held it out to Carmen, who slid the tip of her cigarette into the fire. I shook out the match and tossed it down the steps, and for a moment we watched the blackened and twisted thing smolder.</p>
      <p>She smoked.</p>
      <p>She smoked.</p>
      <p>I expected her to tell me to buzz off. It’s the kind of thing eighteen-year-old women sometimes said to boys like me. Instead she showed me her tattoo. She stretched out her left leg and pulled up her skirt, lifted it past her calf, her knee, her thigh. A skeleton in black robes brandished a scythe just below her hip.</p>
      <p>“Santa Muerte,” Carmen said. “The death saint. In Mexico there’s a cult. It’s huge. People pray to her.”</p>
      <p>“What people?” I said, mesmerized both by the death saint and Carmen’s exposed leg.</p>
      <p>“Criminals. Cartel assassins. They pray for Santa Muerte to bless them before they kill.”</p>
      <p>That’s when I touched her. Without thinking I reached out, traced along the outline of the tattoo with my middle finger. Carmen’s leg felt smoother than anything else in my life.</p>
      <p>“Do you believe in her?” I said. “Do you think she’s real?”</p>
      <p>My finger traveled to the apex of the scythe blade. The back of my hand brushed against the bunched fabric of her skirt. Carmen took a long time to answer.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes.”</p>
      <p>That’s how Carmen became my first girlfriend.</p>
